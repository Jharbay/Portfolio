    <p>Hi Babe
        I wrote this letter for you because i would like to thank you for always inspiring me everyday specially when I saw you. I feel incomplete if i didn't saw you. You make me butterfly on my stomach the way i see your beautiful and cute face.  You bring out the magic in me. The words you say to me are a wonder to me. You make me laugh, giggle, smile. 
    The music you play to my ears makes me a magnificent person. The books you read make me feel inspired. Are you a wizard, or do you just have a heart. Don't forget,everyone is wonderful. Never give up and do what your heart tells you.I inspires you a lot.  Every second I spend with you feels like how I would think Babe would imagine heaven to be like. I can't imagine that I would be nearly as happy if I didn’t have you in my life. I lose my sense of time when I am around you. When I am with you, I forget about everything going wrong in my life. I didn’t know that my life was the first time I would fall head of heels for someone. Especially not a guy. Thank you for always there for me in good and bad times you always make me special every single day. For almost 3 years we've been together even if we fight but we always choose each other to stay and love and im so thankful for that. I love the way you care and the love you give. But the best thing is your effort and support,and your unconditional love. Thank you for everything just take care always and may god bless you always too. </ph>
